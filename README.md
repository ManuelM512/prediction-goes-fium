# F1 Race Position Prediction - WIP

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the position order of drivers in the next Formula 1 race. By leveraging historical race data and various features such as driver performance, team performance, track characteristics, the model will provide insights and predictions to help understand and anticipate the outcomes of upcoming races. This predictive capability can be valuable for teams, analysts, and enthusiasts who are keen on making data-driven decisions and analyses.

## Technologies I want to use
The project utilizes a range of technologies and tools to ensure accurate predictions, efficient model training, and effective experimentation tracking. Below are the key technologies used:

- **Hyperparameter Search**: To optimize the performance of the machine learning models, employing hyperparameter search techniques to find the best combination of parameters.
- **MLflow**: This tool will be used for tracking experiments, managing the lifecycle of machine learning models, and keeping a detailed record of all experiments and their results.
- **Gradio**: To create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model, allowing users to input new race data and get position predictions.
- **Random Forest and XGBoost**: These powerful ensemble learning algorithms will be used to build robust models for predicting race outcomes.
- **FastAI or AutoGluon**: One of these high-level machine learning libraries will be used for building and training our models, taking advantage of their advanced features and ease of use.
